**The 38th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory**

| **Where:** Bonn, Germany

The International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory is an annual conference that attracts scientists
from around the world. Originally started as a place for physicists to discuss their recent
developments in lattice gauge theory, nowadays the conference is the largest of its type and has grown
to include areas like algorithms and machine architectures, code development, chiral symmetry, physics
beyond the standard model, and strongly interacting phenomena in low-dimensions.
