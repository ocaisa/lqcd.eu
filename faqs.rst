How to become a member of EuroLat
---------------------------------

EuroLat is an association open to any Euro-based institution or collaboration.
If you are the coordinator of a research group in a European **institution**, or you are the spokeman
of a Euro-based **collaboration** (i.e. involving European institutions), please contact one of the members
of the Ad-hoc commitee at these contacts to be added to the internal EuroLat decision board.

If instead you are a **researcher** in Lattice Field Theory interested in the activities of EuroLat, please
join the :ref:`Mailing List <Mailing List>` to be updated on the news of the community.


How to add content to the website
---------------------------------

The following elements are the content of the website:

- **Homepage:** the content of the homepage is decided by the EuroLat :ref:`Ad hoc Commitee`.

- **Institutions:** any European institution engaged in research in Lattice Field Theory can be added
  to the list of :ref:`Institutions`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewa7fimzLeaXI0ds0im74AkaTS6TNYSBs9W7qLz32uaYqYlw/viewform>`_, contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or
  :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of the institution, a contact person and
  a website of the group. The intitutions are sorted on a nation base and then in alphabetic
  order.
  
- **Collaborations:** any Euro-based collaboration, i.e. with most of the members working in European
  institutions, can be added to the list of :ref:`Collaborations`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fq5kP24L1Z8FOuOAym5QePac9fMfeCVebG6TXodA7Yw/viewform>`_,
  contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the collaboration, the spokeman of the collaboration, the website of the collaboration and a short
  description of the purpose of the collaboration. The collaborations are sorted in alphabetic
  order.

- **Events:** any event taking place in Europe open to the European Lattice Field Theory community
  can be added to the list of :ref:`Upcoming Events`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15Pn_O6kPb-uxnjWV_LYq1MfsK3T6JZMDqufS1x3KBAw/viewform>`_,
  contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the event, place and date and a webpage of the event. The events are sorted in chronological
  order and once the event is passed, will be moved to the list of :ref:`Past Events`.

- **Job Opportunities:** any open position in Europe for Lattice Field Theory researchers can be added to the list
  of :ref:`Job Opportunities <Job Opportunities>`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DvUdgoFJI02AGixsOPFjJs7mjjcz2bGo7wmx1gcf4Ng/viewform>`_, contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or
  :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need the rank of the position, the institution, a deadline
  of the call, a link to the official call and if necessary a very short description of the position.
  The positions are sorted on a rank base (e.g. from professorship to PhD fellowship), then
  on a nation base and then in chronological order accordingly to the deadline. The Job position will
  be removed once the deadline is passed or if the submitter asks to remove it.

- **Research topics:** description of the research topics and activities can be added to one of
  the sections in te sidebar under Research topics. The description should be suitable for generic
  audience, it should include refence to external material and/or publications and it should include
  some representative figures from selected results. We would prefer if either you prepare the content,
  see :ref:`DIY <DIY>`, or you provide the complete text in tex formar to the :ref:`Web-manager`. 

- **Software:** any open source software for Lattice Field Theory developed or used by Euro-based
  researchers in their activities and meant for public usage can be added to the list of :ref:`Software`.
  You can either contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the software, the license, a short (usage) and a longer description and a link to the source-code of
  the software. The collaborations are sorted in alphabetic order.

- **Computing Facilities:** any computing facility providing computer time for research in
  Lattice Field Theory to the European community can be added to the list of :ref:`Computing Facilities`. You can either contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`.
