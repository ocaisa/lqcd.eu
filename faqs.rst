What is Eurolat
---------------
:ref:`EuroLat` is an association of the European Lattice Field Theory Community.
The Lattice Field Theory community in Europe is comprised of several collaborations, as well as smaller groups.
Together they are part of an international research effort, and many of the larger collaborations have
participating researchers from outside Europe. Major collaborations are :ref:`ALPHA`,
:ref:`BMW`, :ref:`CLS`, :ref:`ETMC`, :ref:`HotQCD`, :ref:`QCDSF`, and :ref:`UKQCD`, each with its own simulation and analysis codes. The community has a long
history in working together in coordinated, EU funded research programs. The first such program was the
European Community Network "Computational Particle Physics" (1993-1997). Currently members of the
Lattice QCD community coordinate the European Network for Particle Physics, Lattice Field Theory and
Extreme Computing (EurPLEx), and participate in a number of EU projects, including `STRONG-2020 <http://www.strong-2020.eu/>`_ funded
under the European Integrating Activity for Advanced Community initiative.

Representatives of all the aforementioned collaborations and selected groups have been contacted and
a consensus has been reached to establish a five-member working group to respond to the request for
input by PRACE, consisting of :ref:`C. Alexandrou <Prof. Constantia Alexandrou>` (Cyprus),
:ref:`L. Del Debbio <Prof. Luigi Del Debbio>` (UK), :ref:`F. Karsch <Prof. Frithjof Karsch>` (Germany),
:ref:`S. Ryan <Prof. SinÃ©ad Ryan>` (Ireland) and :ref:`H. Wittig <Prof. Hartmut Wittig>` (Germany).


How to become a member of EuroLat
---------------------------------

EuroLat is an association open to any **researcher** in Lattice Field Theory working for an Euro-based institution or collaboration.
If you belong to the above category and you want to join EuroLat, please complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6mpUmYDChqECVvtBKgrT2_JOeBkP5DlBAVlhY_Ohdkv18ag/viewform>`_. We will also add you to our :ref:`Mailing List`.

If you are the **coordinator** of a research group in a European institution, or you are the **spokeperson**
of a Euro-based collaboration (i.e. involving European institutions), after compleating the above-mentioned form, please, send an email to eurolat@googlegroups.com to be added to the EuroLat board members.


What is lqcd.eu
---------------

LQCD.eu is the webpage of the European Lattice Field theory community and it is supported by the EuroLat association. The complete website is currently under construction. For seeing the latest version please check https://eurolat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

The website is meant to advertise events, research activities, results, projects and job opportunities
of the European Lattice Field Theory community. If you have any content of this kind you want to advertise on the
website, please read :ref:`How to add content to the website <How to add content to the website>`.


How to add content to the website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following components will be the content of the website:

- **Institutions:** any European institution engaged in research in Lattice Field Theory can be added
  to the list of :ref:`Institutions`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewa7fimzLeaXI0ds0im74AkaTS6TNYSBs9W7qLz32uaYqYlw/viewform>`_, contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or
  :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of the institution, a contact person and
  a website of the group. The intitutions are sorted on a nation base and then in alphabetic
  order.
  
- **Collaborations:** any Euro-based collaboration, i.e. with most of the members working in European
  institutions, can be added to the list of :ref:`Collaborations`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fq5kP24L1Z8FOuOAym5QePac9fMfeCVebG6TXodA7Yw/viewform>`_,
  contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the collaboration, the spokeman of the collaboration, the website of the collaboration and a short
  description of the purpose of the collaboration. The collaborations are sorted in alphabetic
  order.

- **Events:** any event taking place in Europe open to the European Lattice Field Theory community
  can be added to the list of :ref:`Upcoming Events`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15Pn_O6kPb-uxnjWV_LYq1MfsK3T6JZMDqufS1x3KBAw/viewform>`_,
  contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the event, place and date and a webpage of the event. The events are sorted in chronological
  order and once the event is passed, will be moved to the list of :ref:`Past Events`.

- **Job Opportunities:** any open position in Europe for Lattice Field Theory researchers can be added to the list
  of :ref:`Job Opportunities <Job Opportunities>`. You can either complete this `form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DvUdgoFJI02AGixsOPFjJs7mjjcz2bGo7wmx1gcf4Ng/viewform>`_, contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or
  :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need the rank of the position, the institution, a deadline
  of the call, a link to the official call and if necessary a very short description of the position.
  The positions are sorted on a rank base (e.g. from professorship to PhD fellowship), then
  on a nation base and then in chronological order accordingly to the deadline. The Job position will
  be removed once the deadline is passed or if the submitter asks to remove it.

- **Research topics:** description of the research topics and activities can be added to one of
  the sections in te sidebar under Research topics. The description should be suitable for generic
  audience, it should include refence to external material and/or publications and it should include
  some representative figures from selected results. We would prefer if either you prepare the content,
  see :ref:`DIY <DIY>`, or you provide the complete text in tex formar to the :ref:`Web-manager`. 

- **Software:** any open source software for Lattice Field Theory developed or used by Euro-based
  researchers in their activities and meant for public usage can be added to the list of :ref:`Software`.
  You can either contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`. For completeness sake, we need a logo of
  the software, the license, a short (usage) and a longer description and a link to the source-code of
  the software. The collaborations are sorted in alphabetic order.

- **Computing Facilities:** any computing facility providing computer time for research in
  Lattice Field Theory to the European community can be added to the list of :ref:`Computing Facilities`. You can either contact the :ref:`Web-manager` or :ref:`DIY`.
