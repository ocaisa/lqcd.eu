Lattice QCD
===========

The strong interactions are responsible for a wide range of complex phenomena in the universe involving
widely different scales from the quark-gluon plasma that was formed :math:`10^{-6}~s` after the Big Bang to the
evolution of neutron stars after billions of years. Lattice QCD allows for an ab-initio non-perturbative solution
of the strong interactions starting directly from the QCD Lagrangian with the same input parameters as those of the
continuum theory, namely the bare quark masses and coupling constant. State-of-the-art simulations are currently
performed at physical values of the quark masses using fine enough lattice spacing a, and large enough volume to
render lattice artifacts under control.
