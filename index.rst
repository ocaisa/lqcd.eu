The European Lattice Field Theory Community
-------------------------------------------

Eurolat is an association of the  European Lattice Field Theory Community.
It includes **X** :ref:`collaborations <Collaborations>` engaged in cutting-edge research in Lattice Field Theory
composed by a large number of researchers from **Y** :ref:`institutions <Institutions>` all around Europe.

The main purpose of EuroLat is to grant community access to the European Lattice Field Theory Community
for computer time on the :ref:`European supercomputers facilities <Computing Facilities>`. The objectives of the association are

- Definition of computing requirements for the Lattice QCD community based on a broad scientific programme 
- Consultation and participation in decisions on hardware procurement, based on community-defined benchmark codes
- Provision of training opportunities for Lattice QCD researchers
- Managing HPC Community Access, provided it is supported by the Lattice QCD community
- Investigation and dissemination of further funding opportunities to benefit the European Lattice Field Theory community at large.
