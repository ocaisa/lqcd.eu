Computing Facilities
====================

The following computing facilities offer access to their supercomputers for
performing reserch in Lattice Field Theories.


Cineca
------

Cineca is the most powerful supercomputing centre for scientific research in Italy,
as stated in the TOP500_ list of the most powerful supercomputers in the world:
Fermi, the supercomputing system IBM Blue Gene/Q installed in June 2012,
and ranked at the 7th position on the list, in 2015 is ranked at the 23rd position.
Another system, Marconi Intel Xeon Phi, is ranked at the 14th position of the list
as of June 2017, with about 6 PFLOPS.

Marconi
^^^^^^^

| **County:** Italy
| **Computing power:** 20 Pflop/s
| **Hardware:** Intel Xeon 8160 (SkyLake)

It is the new Tier-0 system that replaced FERMI in July 2016.
It is based on the LENOVO NeXtScale platform and the next generation of the Intel Xeon Phi
product family. It has been gradually upgraded from June 2016. The actual configuration consists
of Marconi-A3 with SkyLake (in production since August 2017, upgraded in January 2018 and completed
in November 2018) and the incoming Marconi-100 expected in March 2020.
